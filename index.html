        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business EconomicsðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Dillon Lee, and Iâ€™m a Business Economics student at the University of California, Riverside, expecting to graduate in June 2028. With a current GPA of 3.85, Iâ€™ve been dedicated to building a strong academic foundation in economics, accounting, statistics, and business fundamentals. Alongside my coursework, Iâ€™ve earned certifications in Data Analytics for Business Professionals and Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy through LinkedIn Learningâ€”both of which reflect my interest in how technology continues to shape the future of business.<br><br>

       Since starting college, Iâ€™ve become actively involved with the Highlander Business Society, a student-led organization focused on professional development. Through my participation, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to network with over 50 business professionals, attend mentorship seminars, and contribute to a mock product development project with a team of peers. We created a comprehensive business plan that we presented to an audience, sharpening my skills in collaboration, public speaking, and strategic thinking.<br><br>

        My work experience has been just as formative. Most recently, I worked as a Grocery Clerk at Sprouts Farmers Market, where I assisted around 30 customers per shift and helped manage product restockingâ€”moving close to 100 boxes per day. I improved shelf presentation and supported multiple departments, which led to noticeable improvements in both customer satisfaction and store efficiency.

Prior to that, I was a Busser at Hoorah Bar & Cafe. While there, I supported servers, managed table turnover, and directly assisted customers to help ensure a smooth dining experience. I also played a role in organizing seasonal art sale events, where I helped set up spaces for local vendors to display and sell their products. These experiences taught me a lot about customer service, attention to detail, and staying calm under pressure.

Outside of work and school, community service has always been important to me. I served as Vice President for both the SAVE Promise Club and the Food Drive Club at Del Norte High School. With SAVE Promise, I led presentations for over 800 students ranging from elementary to middle school, focusing on mental health, inclusivity, and school safety. I also helped organize multiple school walkouts to honor victims of school shootings and advocate for reform.

With the Food Drive Club and through my volunteer work with Feeding San Diego, I helped raise over $7,000 in monetary and food donations through coordinated school drives. I also spent over 30 hours volunteering directlyâ€”preparing nutrition baskets and guiding new volunteers while improving warehouse efficiency by maintaining a clean, organized work environment.

In everything I do, I aim to bring a balance of professionalism, creativity, and compassion. Iâ€™m always looking to growâ€”whether thatâ€™s through hands-on experience, academic study, or community involvement. Iâ€™m excited about the possibilities ahead in business, and I hope to apply my skills and experiences to roles that make a real impact.
